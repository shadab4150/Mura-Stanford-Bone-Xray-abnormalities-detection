### MURA **(musculoskeletal radiographs)** is a large dataset of bone X-rays of seven body parts.

### Objective:
* **To build  an image classifier that can distinguish between Normal and Abnormal bone Deformaties by seeing the X-Ray images.**


**MURA is one of the largest public radiographic image datasets offered by Stanford University.**



## Dataset:
* To obtain the dataset please contact [**StanfordMLGroup**](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/) or email them. They will send a download link along with a **Research Use Agreement** contract form.
